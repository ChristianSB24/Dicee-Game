# DICEE Game from Web Development Bootcamp - UDemy
In this application I used the Math library from JavaScript to create randomized dice and 
used functions such as document.querySelector().setAttribute and document.querySelector().textContent to update the DOM. Udemy provided the skeleton of the project such as the HTML layout, pictures, and CSS styling, but I created the JavaScript index.js file independently.
